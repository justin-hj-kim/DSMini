/* Q6: You'd like to get the first and last name of the last member(s)
who signed up. Do not use the LIMIT clause for your solution. */

SELECT firstname, surname

		this Darren Smith is the correct entry memid 37.

facility, the name of the member formatted as a single column, and the cost.
Order by descending cost, and do not use any subqueries. */

The output of facility name and total revenue, sorted by revenue. Remember
that there's a different cost for guests and members! */
